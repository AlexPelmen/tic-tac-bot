# tic-tac-bot
Tic-tac game with bot

This project took a lot of time of mine, but now it's finished. You need to know, this game is not typical "tic-tac" as we usually play. I use **javascript** for this project, cause I wanted to make it as a web-page (It's still working fast and I wonder). Also it uses **bootstrap4**.
***

### Game rules:
The same as usual tic-tac, but the **gamefield is huge** and the goal is to **set 5 figures in row**;
***

### About bot:
Bot scans all cell in the area around figures on the gamefield, count a weight of each cell and set his figure on the most suitable. I hope, I would have a will to improve it, cause he can make some stupid de—Åisions. It would be nice, to use depth search to predict steps. Also, it do not use minimax algo to evaluate steps, it uses my algo( perhabs it's not so good )

### Also:
It's a good timekiller, seriosly ( at least for me, as for developer))) ). Here's two-players mode (just for one device), adaptive design for phones.

Do you think, if the code is piece of shit: I'm sorry)
